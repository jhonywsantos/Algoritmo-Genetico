# Algoritmo-Genetico
This work presents the development of a genetic algorithm for route optimization, applied to the Traveling Salesman Problem, with enhanced visualization capabilities. The solution implements selection, crossover, and mutation operators, combined with elitism, to maximize the performance of generated routes. The graphical interface allows real-time monitoring of the solutions’ evolution, displaying performance metrics and intermediate routes.
